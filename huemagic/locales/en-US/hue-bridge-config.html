Connects to a Philips Hue bridge.

### Name

You can either assign an alternative, internal name for the bridge or keep the default name.

### Bridge IP & Port

Enter the Hue Bridge IP address manually or press the button to call up all locally available bridges (static IP configuration on the Hue Bridge recommended). You can also optionally define an alternative port for the bridge by adding a colon to the IP address.

### API key

Enter the Hue Bridge API key manually or press the button to create a new key. If you want to create a new key, you have to press the physical button of the bridge within the time window of 20 seconds to complete the process.

### Automatic firmware updates

HueMagic periodically checks for available Philips Hue firmware updates and automatically installs them when they are available. You can deactivate this behavior by clicking the corresponding checkbox.

### Deactivate notifications

If you activate this setting, all nodes behind this bridge will no longer receive automatic status messages.
